    <p>My name is Xavier Frankline, I am a passionate, ambitious and driven person. I enjoy the small things in life, and above all I belive life is all about being happy.We all deserve to be happy.</p>

    <p>I am a graduate of Telecommunications and Information Engineering fom JKUAT.My professional experience include stints at Huawei Technologies Kenya Ltd. and Standard Media Group Ltd. as an Intern and a role as a Field Support Engineer at Jamii Telecommunications Ltd (Faiba).</p>

    <p>Earlier this year, I decided that I needed to learn the art of programming since this would have enabled me apply technology as a solution to most of the challenges we face as a society. I belive my calling is to make chage in society and I believe I will be able to do that. </p>
